1/ People study medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) because of its key role in navigation and memory.
In our new paper we build neural network models that explain the full diversity of neural responses in MEC.

2/ tl;dr Focus less on specialty cell types and hand-crafted models. Instead, build network models that capture architectural and functional constraints that shape the MEC population as a whole.

3/ Famous experiments identified special cell types in MEC (e.g. grid & border cells). Recent neural networks solving path integration tasks have some internal units that look surprisingly like grid / border cells.  @weixx2, Chris Cueva, @AndreaBanino, @caswellcaswell

4/ But the great majority of MEC neurons don't exhibit such cleanly stereotyped firing patterns.  What characterizes these "heterogeneous" cells, and are they important?  (Reminiscent of Bruno Olshausen's  "other 85% of V1") [figure]

5/ Unlike hand-crafted models, learned neural networks also have heterogeneous units that potentially might be like those in the real brain.  But do they *actually* look like real MEC cells, quantitatively?

6/ We evaluated a variety of network models and found that -- for the right combination of circuit architecture and task -- learned models are *way* better at capturing response patterns of most MEC cells.  [figure]

7/ We also performed in-silico knockout experiments, finding that heterogeneous cells are just as likely to be causally implicated in MEC functionality as grid/border cells.  Maybe grid cells aren't especially special, but just easy to visualize? [figure]

8/ In fact, task-optimized networks capture not just spatial responses of MEC cells, but also reward modulation, in a single simple unified model.  [figure]

9/ Our results suggest how specific processes of biological performance optimization may have directly shaped the neural mechanisms in MEC as a whole, and provides a path for enlarging the study of MEC beyond overly-restrictive response stereotypes.

10/ But do we really think our best model ("UGRNN-ReLU") is *actually* the correct circuit structure of MEC?  Not really.  It does explain practically all the response variability in a wide spectrum of data, BUT the real implication ...

11/ ...is that the data is probably too limited.  Future work in MEC should much more seriously engage mice in more complex environments & behaviors to strongly falsify current models and better constrain network architectures.

12/ We've made our models, training code, and neural fitting pipeline publicly available in case you may want to benchmark your own neural data.
